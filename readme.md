## üöÄ Features

- Dynamic UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Email verification (OTP-based) before storing data in HubSpot CRM
- Dynamic API integration for performance calculations
- Embedded via `<iframe>` or `<script>`
- HubSpot Email Capture Simulation (for integration)

## üßæ Final Integration Guide

This document outlines how to manage and update core features of the **Hospital Impact Calculator**, including:

1. Updating the **PDF Report Text**
2. Managing the **OTP Workflow**
3. Understanding the **PDF Generation Service**
4. **HubSpot CRM Integration**

---

### üìù 1. Updating the PDF Report Text

**Files Involved:**

- `components/PDFReport/surgical-report.tsx` ‚Äì Main layout and text structure for the PDF.
- `components/PDFReport/styles/pdf-print.css` ‚Äì Print styling used when Puppeteer generates the PDF.
- `app/pdf-render/page.tsx` ‚Äì Web preview for the final PDF layout.

**How to Edit:**

- Static labels, headings, and section titles can be edited directly in `surgical-report.tsx`.
- Dynamic content (e.g., case volume, cost savings) is passed as props from API responses or form inputs.
- Use `app/pdf-render/page.tsx` in the browser to visually confirm updates before triggering PDF generation.

### üîê 2. OTP Verification Workflow

**Files Involved:**

- `components/ui/email-verification.tsx`
- Environment Variable: `.env ‚Üí OTP_SECRET`
- Email Service API: `RESEND_API_KEY` (or SendGrid equivalent)

**How it Works:**

1. User enters their email after the summary report is shown.
2. OTP is generated using a secret stored in `OTP_SECRET`.
3. The OTP is sent via email using Resend/SendGrid.
4. User submits the OTP to the verification endpoint.
5. If correct:

   - The request for a detailed performance report is submitted.
   - User data is logged in HubSpot via API.

**What Can Be Configured:**

- Email template
- OTP expiration logic
- API routes for `send-otp` and `verify-otp`

### üìÑ 3. PDF Generation (Puppeteer Service)

**Web Preview Page:** `app/pdf-render/page.tsx`

**How It Works:**

- Puppeteer runs on fluid compute on vercel.
- The service loads `https://hospital-impact-calculator.vercel.app/pdf-render?data=encodedDataStoredInLocalStorage` in headless Chrome.
- It renders the page exactly as seen in the browser, then generates and returns a PDF.

**Integration Notes:**

- Ensure all dynamic data is rendered in the page prior to Puppeteer snapshot.
- PDF styles are defined in `pdf-print.css`. Use print-safe colors, font sizes, and spacing.
- The service accepts a URL and returns a binary PDF. Optional: send it to the user via email or log to CRM.

### üß© 4. HubSpot Integration

**What It Does:**

After email verification, a contact is either created or updated in HubSpot with the following data:

| Field             | Description                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Email             | From verified OTP input                |
| Name              | Can be static or optional              |
| Calculator Source | e.g., "Hospital Impact Calculator"     |
| Report Link       | Optional: base64 or public link to PDF |

**HubSpot API Handling:**

- On form submission ‚Üí backend checks if contact exists.
- If exists ‚Üí updates record with new data.
- If not ‚Üí creates a new contact with the fields.
- Uses HubSpot access token stored securely in the environment or backend service.
